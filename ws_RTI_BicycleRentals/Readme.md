# Real-time intelligence project
Real-time intelligence in Microsoft Fabric helps to extract insights and visualize streaming data in motion. This project provides an end-to-end solution for event-driven scenarios, streaming data, and log analysis.
It covers both set up and use the main features of real-time intelligence with a sample dataset provided by Microsoft Fabric named as Bicycle Rentals.

# Scenario
The sample data used in this project is a set of bicycle data that includes information about bike ID, location, timestamp, and more. We will learn how to set up resources, ingest data, set alerts on the data, and visualize the data to extract insights as follows:

 - Set up your environment
 - Get data in the Real-Time hub
 - Transform events
 - Publish an eventstream
 - Use update policies to transform data in Eventhouse
 - Use Copilot to create a KQL query
 - Create a KQL query
 - Create an alert based on a KQL query
 - Create a Real-Time dashboard
 - Explore data visually in the Real-Time dashboard
 - Set up anomaly detection on Eventhouse tables
 - Create a map using geospatial data
 - Set an alert on the eventstream
